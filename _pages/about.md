Hi! I am a final-year undergraduate student at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/), majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Statistics. My academic journey and research experiences have fueled my passion for advancing machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in tackling foundational challenges in vision models.

### Research Interests

- Generalization and robust adaptation of foundation models for domain shifts and low-resource tasks  
- Universal representation learning across diverse modalities, including images, texts, video, and sensor data  
- Multitasking within unified frameworks for image-, region-, and pixel-level tasks  
- Self-supervised and continual learning to enable autonomous model evolution  

I have had the privilege of working with exceptional mentors, including [Prof. Seyda Ertekin](https://avesis.metu.edu.tr/sertekin) at METU, [Prof. Ioannis Kakadiaris](https://uh.edu/cbl/people/about-director.php) at the University of Houston, and [Prof. Yukun Hu](https://ucl.ac.uk) at University College London. These collaborations have allowed me to work on impactful projects ranging from developing robust computer vision pipelines to leveraging large language models for automated hyperparameter optimization.

### Future Directions

I want to build lifelong learning systems that adapt autonomously to new tasks and domains without manual intervention. These systems will address challenges like domain generalization, multimodal representation learning, and efficient knowledge transfer. My long-term goal is to lead research in scalable vision systems and mentor the next generation of researchers in the field.
