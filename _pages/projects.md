# Projects

* **Common Carotid Artery Segmentation** (Sep. 2023 – Present)  
    Independent research on benchmarking segmentation models (U-Net, FPN) for the [Common Carotid Artery Ultrasound Images dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/d4xt63mgjm/1) from Mendeley, achieving a 91.86% Jaccard index. Currently exploring few-shot segmentation with SAM for medical imaging applications.

* **Early Sepsis Detection** (Jan. 2024 – July 2024)  
    Graduate course project supervised by [Prof. Erdem Akagunduz](https://avesis.metu.edu.tr/akaerdem). Developed a multistep forecasting model to predict sepsis onset 12 hours before critical stages. Improved recall in pre-sepsis hours using custom CNN+LSTM model with weighted loss function.

* **Class-Specific Data Augmentation for Breast Cancer Classification** (Jan. 2022 – July 2022)  
    Graduate course project supervised by [Prof. Seyda Ertekin](https://avesis.metu.edu.tr/sertekin). Introduced class-specific data augmentation to enhance minority class detection in Vision Transformer-based models, achieving an 11% F1-score increase on average.
